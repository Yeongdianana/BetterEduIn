# AcademicRecords Smart Contract

## Vision
The AcademicRecords smart contract aims to revolutionize the management of academic certificates by leveraging blockchain technology. This decentralized system ensures that certificates are tamper-proof, easily verifiable, and can only be issued by authorized educational institutions. Our goal is to establish a trustworthy, transparent, and secure platform for issuing and verifying academic credentials globally.
